# Mafia - How to play

### Overview
This is a game where there are 2 "sides", the mafia and the villagers. The mafia try to kill all the villagers and the villagers try to catch and execute the mafia before it is too late. Best played in a large group.

### Setup
The following roles are randomly assigned to the players before the games starts:
* Mafia [1-2]: The villains. At night, they will try to kill the other villages (one each) by pointing to them.
* Necromancer [1-2]: The saviours. At night, they will try to resurrect villagers by pointing to them. This only works if their targets have been killed by the mafia in that particular night.
* Cops [1-2]: Kinda useless tbh. At night, they will point to the person(s) they suspect are the mafia. This will be confirmed or invalidated by the conductor. They can then use this information to try to convince the other villagers during discussion time.
* Villagers [remaining]: The citizens. These don't have a role at night, but will participate in a discussion and voting process during the day. Whoever they find to be the most suspicious gets executed.

There is also a conductor, who is not an active player but helps carry out the game by talking to the players as required. They will know the roles of everyone and will not participate in the discussion.

### Gameplay
1. It is nighttime. Everybody closes their eyes.
2. The mafia are asked to open their eyes. They will point to villagers they would like to kill (1 per mafia member), and go back to sleep.
3. The necromancers are asked to open their eyes. They will point to villagers they would like to resurrect (1 each), and go back to sleep.
4. The police are asked to open their eyes. They will point to the villagers they suspect, which the conductor will confirm or deny, and go back to sleep.
5. Everyone awakens. Those killed by the mafia and not resurrected are out of play for that game. The rest of the villagers can discuss
6. Voting for each player. Each player gets 2 votes.
7. The one with the highest votes is executed. **In case of multiple mafia, it is not revealed whether this person was actually guilty**.

### Game end conditions
The game will end either if
* All mafia members have been executed
* `num(mafia) >= num(remaining)`

#### Happy hunting!
